        <h2>Rule of Thirds</h2>

        <p>To me, the National Wildlife Federation is a good example of the rule of thirds because a large part of the appeal of their site is photos of nature and wildlife that goes on in the park. All of these photos are very well done and use the rule of thirds to keep the attention focused on the primary object of the photo. </p>

        <h2>Visual Hierarchy</h2>

        <p>Visual hierarchy is when size, colors, and emphasis is used to highlight the most important parts of a webpage. This site primarily focuses on selling merchandise, and you can easily tell what product the MrBeast team is pushing at each part of the page. This could also be a good example of contrast becuase of the bright colors and the white background but I also think the visual hierarch is very obvious everywhere you look on this webpage.</p>

        <h2>PARC: Proximity</h2>
        <div> Wendys Website</div>

        <p>Wendys has a very similar set up to many other resturaunts when it comes to menu orgranization. They use proximity by keeping similar items on the same part of the page, keeping your focus in one specific area. They have the entree options at the top, breakfast items in the middle, and beverage options on bottom. This helps customers decide what types of foods they want to eat before they have chosen a specific item. The use of proximity also helps with Hicks law with each food category reducing the number of options you have to choose from.  </p>
